      Problem Statement(Round 1):
    </h1>
    <p>
      With the inclusive development in this changing era, there have been many unfamiliar structural,commercial, and
      social problems that make affect our lives drastically. But with the combination of Innovative ideas and
      technology
      we can solve these problems effectively and efficiently. Some of these problems come from the areas such
      pollution(
      Air, Water, Soil) , agriculture, defence and security, disaster management, transportation facilitation, health
      and
      medical issues etc.
      For the Aavishkar Challenge, students will have to suggest simple, effective, and feasible solution to solve
      problems near your locality and environment. There is no word limit for your answer report but it is mandatory to
      make a 2D/3D drawing of your design labelling different parts and explaining various functions of each parts.
